Rules
----------------

Please follow these basic rules in order to keep this place nice:

- Do not insult, troll or harass anyone
- Do a [small research](https://github.com/FrozenSand/UrbanTerror42/issues?q=is%3Aissue+) before posting a new issue to avoid duplication
- Do not "UP" the issues yourself, it won't make us process them faster
- Do not use ALL CAPS - we are not blind (yet)


Reporting Issues
----------------

If you encounter a bug while using Urban Terror 4.2, please first check that [a similar issue hasn't been opened yet](https://github.com/FrozenSand/UrbanTerror42/issues).

Please place huge logs using tools like [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com) or [Gist](https://gist.github.com).

Feature Requests

While we always appreciate new feature requests, please note that we are heavily working on Urban Terror HD and we are probably not going to implement *huge* changes to Urban Terror 4.2 anymore.
Nevertheless, a section of our forums is dedicated to suggestions, feel free to post [there](http://www.urbanterror.info/forums/forum/57-42-suggestions/).
